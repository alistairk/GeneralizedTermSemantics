Step 1

To build a matrix run:
java BuildMatrix <N|V|A> <output Directory> <output File Name> <min Term Frequency> <min Context Frequency> <parsedFile 1> ... <parsedFile n>

Step2

Reweight the matrix with either the unsupervised, context-supervised or relation-supervised system. Choose one of these three:

unsupervised:
To Run Program: java WeightFeaturesUnsupervised <PMI|LL|F|Tscore|Zscore|Chi2> <rlabel file> <row matrix file> <column matrix file>

context-supervised:
To Run Program: java WeightFeaturesUnsupervised <PMI|LL|F|Tscore|Zscore|Chi2> <training data> <row_features.csv file> <row matrix file> <column matrix file> <output column file>

relation-supervised:
needs fixing

Step 2a

If you used supervised Matrix reweighting then you can run the unsupervised re-weighting on top of it.
This was found to create the best results.
